# Euro Coin Count

Euro Coin Count is an application that given a number of pennies will calculate the minimum number of pound sterling coins needed to make that amount.

The app accounts for only the common €2, €1, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c, 2c and 1c coins.

## Illustration
Below are sample inputs and an idea of what the output should be:
* 123c = 1 x €1, 1 x 20c, 1 x 2c, 1 x 1c.
* £12.34 = 6 x €2, 1 x 20c, 1 x 10c, 2 x 2c.
